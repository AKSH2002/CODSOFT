# 📋 Todo List GUI 📋

The Todo List GUI is a simple Python application developed using the tkinter library. It provides an intuitive graphical interface for users to manage and organize their tasks efficiently. The application allows users to create, update, and track their to-do lists seamlessly. ✨📅

Adding a task is as simple as typing the task title in the input field and clicking the "Add Task" button. The application dynamically displays the tasks on the list, making it easy to visualize the entire to-do list at a glance. To facilitate task editing, users can select any task from the list, and its title will automatically populate the input field. After editing the title, clicking the "Edit Task" button updates the task with the new information. 📝💡

When it comes to task deletion, the application ensures a streamlined process by displaying a confirmation message before permanently removing the selected task. The Todo List GUI emphasizes simplicity and responsiveness, automatically adjusting its layout based on the window size, making it ideal for users on various devices and screen resolutions. Whether for personal productivity or team collaboration, the Todo List GUI is a reliable tool to enhance task management and improve overall organization. 🚀🔍

## 💻 Run Locally
Make sure that Python3 is install in system 


1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   
     ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/AKSH2002/CODSOFT.git
     ```


2. **Navigate to Directory**: Change into the project directory:
   
     ```bash
      cd CODSOFT
      cd To-Do List
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. Install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file using pip:
   
     ```bash
      pip install -r requirements.txt
     ``` 

4. **Run the App**: Execute the `To-Do List.py` file form Password Generator folder to launch the app:

5. **Interface**: The app GUI will open in a new window, prompting you to start managing your tasks using the intuitive graphical interface.

6. **Interact with the Todo List:**: The application window will open, presenting you with an input field to add new tasks, a list of existing tasks, and buttons to edit and delete tasks. You can add tasks by entering the title in the input field and clicking "Add Task." To edit a task, select it from the list, modify the title, and click "Edit Task." Similarly, to delete a task, select it and click "Delete Task," with a confirmation prompt for your safety.
