# 🧮 Calculator GUI using tkinter 🧮

This project is a user-friendly calculator Graphical User Interface (GUI) developed with the `tkinter` library in Python. It aims to offer a simple and intuitive experience for performing basic arithmetic calculations and includes advanced functionalities such as square root (√) and factorial (!) operations. ✨

The calculator interface consists of a large display area where users can input their arithmetic expressions using the provided buttons. It supports standard arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, making it suitable for day-to-day calculations. Additionally, users can take advantage of the square root (√) operation to quickly find the square root of a given number or the factorial (!) operation to calculate the factorial of an integer. 🌟

🔍 The "C" button allows users to clear the entry field, enabling them to start new calculations easily. Moreover, the "<_" button serves as a backspace, making it convenient to correct any mistakes made during the input process. ⚡️

This calculator GUI project is an excellent tool for both beginners and those looking for a straightforward and efficient solution for their daily calculations. Whether it's a quick addition or a complex expression, this GUI provides an interactive and reliable platform to perform various mathematical tasks with ease. 💫🌈

We welcome contributions from the community to enhance and improve this project.

See `Run Locally` for ways to get started.

Please adhere to this project's `code of conduct`.


## 💻 Run Locally
Make sure that Python3 is install in system 


1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   
     ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/AKSH2002/CODSOFT.git
     ```


2. **Navigate to Directory**: Change into the project directory:
   
     ```bash
      cd CODSOFT
      cd Calculator
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. Install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file using pip:
   
     ```bash
      pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

4. **Run the App**: Execute the `Calculator.py` file form Calculator folder to launch the app:

5. **Interface**: The app GUI will open in a new window, prompting you to start using the calculator

6. **Interact with the Calculator**: Enter arithmetic expressions using the provided buttons for numbers, arithmetic operations, square root, and factorial. To perform a calculation, click the "=" button. The result will be displayed in the entry field. Use the "C" button to clear the entry field, and the "<_" button to delete the last character.

7. **Quitting the Application**: To close the Calculator GUI, simply close the window, or you can use the standard closing method for your operating system (e.g., clicking the 'X' button in the top-right corner). That's it! You have now successfully run the Calculator GUI locally on your computer. Enjoy performing arithmetic calculations and exploring its advanced functionalities.
