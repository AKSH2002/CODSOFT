We welcome contributions from the community to enhance and improve this project.

See `Run Locally` for ways to get started.

Please adhere to this project's `code of conduct`.


## 💻 Run Locally
Make sure that Python3 is install in system 

###  Using Virtual Environment (Recommended)


1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   
     ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/AKSH2002/CODSOFT.git
     ```


2. **Navigate to Directory**: Change into the project directory:
   
     ```bash
      cd CODSOFT
      cd weather_forcast_app
     ```


3. **Create a Virtual Environment**: Create a virtual environment for the project to keep dependencies isolated:

   - **For Windows**:
   
     ```bash
      python -m venv venv
     ```

   - **For macOS/Linux**:

     ```bash
     python3 -m venv venv
     ```

4. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:

   - **For Windows**:
   
     ```bash
      venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - **For macOS/Linux**:

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

5. **Install Dependencies**: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. Install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file using pip:
   
     ```bash
      pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

6. **Obtain API Key**: Sign up for a free OpenWeatherMap account and acquire an API key. Replace `"YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"` in the `config.py` file with your unique API key.

7. **Run the App**: Execute the `weather_app_gui.py` file form weather_app_GUI folder to launch the app:

8. **Interface**: The web app GUI will open in a new window, prompting you to enter the name of a city or a zip code.

9. **Retrieve Weather Data**: Input the desired location and click the "Get Weather" button to fetch the latest weather information.

10. **Weather Details**: The weather details, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a short description, will be displayed on the interface.
