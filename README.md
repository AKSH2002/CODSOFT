## Projects 📂

1. **[Calculator](https://github.com/AKSH2002/CODSOFT/tree/master/Calculator) 🧮**
     - 🧮 The Calculator project was the first task of my internship. I developed a simple yet functional calculator application using Python and the Tkinter library for GUI development. The calculator performs basic arithmetic operations like addition ➕, subtraction ➖, multiplication ✖️, and division ➗. It also has a clear button (C) 🆑 to reset the input and result fields. The Calculator project allowed me to familiarize myself with event handling and building user-friendly interfaces. 🚀

<br>

2. **[Todo-list](https://github.com/AKSH2002/CODSOFT/tree/master/To-Do%20List) 📝**
     - The Todo-list project was a task to implement a to-do list application using Python and Tkinter. The application allows users to add, update, and delete tasks ✔️📝, as well as mark them as complete ✅. It also features a due date 📅 and priority functionality to better organize tasks 🔝. Developing this project enhanced my skills in data handling 🗃️, file I/O 💾, and GUI design 🎨.

<br>

3. **[Password Generator](https://github.com/AKSH2002/CODSOFT/tree/master/Password%20Generator) 🔒**
     - The Password Generator project involved creating a secure password generator using Python 🔒🐍. The application allows users to specify the length of the password and includes options for including uppercase letters 🔠, lowercase letters, numbers 🔢, and special characters 🌟. This task allowed me to gain insights 🎯 into random number generation 🎲, string manipulation 🔧, and building robust password management systems 💪.

<br>

4. **[Quiz Game](https://github.com/AKSH2002/CODSOFT/tree/master/Quiz%20Game) 🎲**
     - The Quiz Game project challenged me to build an interactive quiz game using Python and Tkinter 🎲🐍. The application reads quiz questions and multiple-choice options from a JSON file 📋 and displays them to the user 👤. The user can select an answer and get immediate feedback on whether their response was correct ✅ or not ❌. This task honed my skills in handling JSON data 🗂️, designing game mechanics 🎮, and GUI interaction 🖱️.

<br>

5. **[Weather Forecast](https://github.com/AKSH2002/CODSOFT/tree/master/weather_forcast_app) ☁️🌤️🌦️**
     - The Weather Forecast project involved integrating an API to fetch real-time weather data for a given location and displaying it to the user ☁️🌤️🌦️. I used Python and Tkinter to create an application where users can enter a city name or ZIP code 🏙️ and get weather information such as temperature 🌡️, humidity 💧, wind speed 💨, and weather condition 🌈. This task improved my knowledge of working with APIs 🌐, handling JSON responses 📊, and creating dynamic GUI elements 🎨.
